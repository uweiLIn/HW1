According to the way to read the data in the example codeï¼Œit runs row by row as a list. 
Hence I aplly the removal of invalid case('-99.000' or '-999.000') during the reading process.
In the process, calculate the 'PRES' value from stations, sum them and count the number of data from certain stations.
And, record sum and num as lists individually.
After reading, I decide to define a new function called "count" with three parameters named (station, sum , num) passing 
the station name, the sum we record and numbers of target station.
In the function "count", print in the form of example output, and calculate mean by division of sum and num.
Output
